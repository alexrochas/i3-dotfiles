# i3 Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for [i3-wm](https://i3wm.org/).

How-to intall:

```
gem install homesick
homesick clone https://github.com/alexrochas/i3-dotfiles
homesick symlink dotfiles
homesick rc dotfiles
```

[Here](https://gist.github.com/alexrochas/45590646bfd89c9762c94e72bd860990) are the other non-essential dotfiles like **xsession config** and **cronjobs**.  
Also, take a look on my other [dotfiles](https://github.com/alexrochas/dotfiles/) like vim and zsh.

*Install with [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).*
